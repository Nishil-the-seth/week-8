# Week 8

Welcome to **Week 8** of the DSA Bootcamp! This week, we will focus on two critical topics in algorithmic problem solving: **Number Theory** and **String Algorithms**.

## Topics Covered

### Number Theory
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**  
   Efficient preprocessing for primes and smallest prime factors.
2. **Euclid's Algorithm**  
   Computing GCD and LCM in logarithmic time.
3. **Modular Exponentiation**  
   Fast power calculation under modulo.
4. **Modular Inverse**  
   Useful in combinatorics and cryptography.

### String Algorithms

1. **Z Algorithm**  
   Linear time pattern matching.
2. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**  
   Efficient dictionary-based prefix searching.
